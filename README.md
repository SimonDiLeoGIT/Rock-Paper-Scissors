## Rules of the game
To play Rock Paper Scissors, each player makes a fist with one hand and then, on the count of three, extends their hand to reveal one of three gestures: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules:

- Rock beats scissors: The rock gesture smashes the scissors gesture.
- Scissors beat paper: The scissors gesture cuts the paper gesture.
- Paper beats rock: The paper gesture covers the rock gesture.

If both players make the same gesture, it is a tie, and the game is played again. The game is typically played in a best-of-three or best-of-five format.

It is essential to note that the game is based on psychology, and players can use this to their advantage. For example, a player may use a specific gesture repeatedly, making the opponent think they will use it again, but then switch to a different gesture to win the game. In the next section, we will discuss strategies for winning the game.
